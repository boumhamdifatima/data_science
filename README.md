# The Analysis

## 1.   What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(6)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].get_legend().remove()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)
    # remove the x-axis tick labels for better readability
    if i != len(job_titles) - 1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

    # label the percentage on the bars
    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va='center')

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in US Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=.8)
plt.show()
```

### Results

*Bar graph visualizing the salary for the top 3 data roles and their top 6 skills associated with each.*

### Insights

*   SQL is the most requested skill for Data Analysts and Data Scientists, with it in over half the job postings for both roles. For Data Engineers, Python is the most sought-after skill, appearing in 68% of job postings.
*   Data Engineers require more specialized technical skills (AWS, Azure, Spark) compared to Data Analysts and Data Scientists who are expected to be proficient in more general data management and analysis tools (Excel, Tableau).
*   Python is a versatile skill, highly demanded across all three roles, but most prominently for Data Scientists (72%) and Data Engineers (65%).
